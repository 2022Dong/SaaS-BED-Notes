# Session 01 Exercises & Journals 

For this week's journal we would like you to do the following:

### Journal: Summarise the Session's Content

After each session (unless indicated in the session) you **must** create **at least one** journal entry.

**In each journal entry**, you must summarise:

- what you have learned, and
- what you have struggled with understanding.

**After each session** you should:

- Perform research into what was taught.
- Use **[https://www.mybib.com/](https://www.mybib.com/)** to add references to your journal entry on the topics covered and any research you are set as part of the class.
- Summarise any learning completed using designated video and/or text-based tutorials.

Each session **may** give more detailed requirements than those indicated above, and these **must** be completed.

Be honest with yourself as to what you did and did not understand. 

### Research

NIL

### Out Of Class Learning

Start the [Pest From Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/pest-from-scratch)  (<https://laracasts.com/series/pest-from-scratch>) free course on Pest and Pest v2. Total video time is approximately 1hr 45min. 

Once completed summarise your learning in the journal as a separate post.

### Found a Problem?
 
If you spotted any problems (including missing details) in notes or other materials, then make sure you note that, and as a big help to your lecturer, you could fork the notes repository, create an issue, create a fix to the issue, and submit a pull request.
