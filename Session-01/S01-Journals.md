# What are they?

Journals are:

- **private to you and the lecturer(s) for the cluster**
- your way of documenting your learning
- your way to show research conducted during learning
- your way of showing active participation
- your way to reflect on the content

They *are* a part of the assessed work you will complete for the cluster.

---

# Why we are using them

We are using the journals as a way to:

- Develop a **reflective learning attitude**
	- This allows you to prove you are involved in your learning
	- This also provides a way for you to ask yourself questions
- Develop your **research and documentation skills**
- Develop an **investigative mindset**

# Your Commitments

You are required to:

- Check the Check the Session Exercises & Journal requirements and follow these instructions.
- As required, create at least one new journal entry for each session, unless otherwise indicated.
- Ensure that all content is meaningful and of benefit to you when you need to recap.

There are no length requirements, but a blank or very short journal may be looked at negatively.

# How to Create a Journal Entry

Open Blackboard
Go to the cluster shell
Click on the "journal" link on the side, or on the welcome page

# What to Include on a Journal Entry

There are many things that you could include on a journal entry.

Most sessions will indicate what is needed.

All entries should:

- Summarise your learning
- Be meaningful in their content
- Use MyBib ([https://mybib.com]) to create Bibliographic entries for Books, Web Sites, Videos, and other references
