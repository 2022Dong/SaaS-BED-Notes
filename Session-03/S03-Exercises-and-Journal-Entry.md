# Session 03 Exercises & Journals 

For this week's journal we would like you to do the following...

### Complete the in class exercises

If you have not done so, please complete the in-class exercises that are contained in the notes.

### Journal Entry: Summarise the Session's Content

For general details on Journal Content see Session 01.

In your Journal answer the following:

1. Identify advantages and disadvantages of SOAP API. Use the table from [S02-What-is-an-API](S02-What-is-an-API.md) (Session 02) for ideas on what to include.
2. What format is the data sent to and from REST, SOAP, gRPC and GraphQL based APIs?

Remember you MUST include references using MyBib APA6/APA7 format to any references used.

### Research

Identify (without using Adrian Gould's Diigo account) a book chapter, article, video tutorial or written tutorial for each of the following:

2. Best practices for designing an API.
3. Best practices for implementing an API.
4. ...

Read through each tutorial, and summarise key points for each one.

Remember you MUST include references using MyBib APA6/APA7 format to any references used.
### Out Of Class Learning

...

Once completed summarise your learning in the journal as a separate post.

### Found a Problem?
 
If you spotted any problems (including missing details) in notes or other materials, then make sure you note that, and as a big help to your lecturer, you could fork the notes repository, create an issue, create a fix to the issue, and submit a pull request.
